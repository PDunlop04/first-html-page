      <h4 class="About">About Pokemon cards</h4>

      <p class="bigger-text"> The pokemon index contains over 1000 unique pocket monsters, this makes "catching them all" quite difficult. To make matters more problematic, there are over 200,000 distinct trading cards. Some of which have chances as low as 0.16%, which is about 1 in 635 packs, while others find themselves at a high of 25% or 1 in 4 packs. That being said, the chances of collecting each and every one of the available cards in one set alone are very low. This makes collecting and gaining new cards all the more exciting as you build a deck of unique trading cards that can be used for battle or collected for value.</p>
